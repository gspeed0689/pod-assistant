# pod-assistant
Old python utility to assist with making a Bentley Pod Creator conversion project file. 

This Python 2.7 utility was made when I was a graduate student to solve an issue with the Bentley Pod Creator. The issue with the program was that when trying to add point cloud files to the conversion software, it would not add all of the files, and subsequent file adding porcesses would still fail to add all of the files. This python utility would create a Bentley Pod Creator compliant XML file with all of the desired point cloud files, the Bentley Pod Creator software would then convert all of the files.
